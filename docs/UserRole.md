# UserRole

High-level organization role applied to users.  Roles define the baseline permissions a user has within an organization:  - ADMIN: Full administrative access including user management, billing,   and organization settings. Can create/modify/delete all resources. - MEMBER: Standard user access. Can create and manage their own resources   (namespaces, collections, clusters) but cannot manage other users or   organization-level settings. - VIEWER: Read-only access. Can view resources and execute retrievers but   cannot create, modify, or delete any resources.

* `VIEWER` (value: `'viewer'`)

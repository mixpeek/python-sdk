# BlobURLRef

Reference to a document-related blob with automatic presigned URL generation.  Represents any file or asset associated with a document, including source media, processed outputs, thumbnails, and artifacts. All blobs with S3 URLs automatically receive presigned URLs when documents are retrieved from the API.  Use Cases:     - Track source media: Original videos, images, or files from buckets     - Reference processed outputs: Video segments, extracted frames, thumbnails     - Link artifacts: Generated reports, analysis results, derived media     - Maintain lineage: Connect processed blobs back to their source blobs  Role Definitions:     - source: Original input media (e.g., uploaded video, bucket object)     - processed: Derived/transformed content (e.g., video segments, extracted frames)     - thumbnail: Preview images for visual content     - artifact: Generated files (reports, analysis outputs)     - aux: Supporting/auxiliary files  Presigned URL Flow:     1. During processing: Store S3 URLs in document_blobs (no presigned URL yet)     2. During retrieval: API automatically adds presigned_url field to each blob     3. Client receives: Both permanent S3 URL and time-limited HTTPS presigned URL  Requirements:     - field: REQUIRED. Semantic label for the blob (e.g., 'video_segment', 'thumbnail')     - url: REQUIRED. S3 or HTTP URL to the blob content     - role: REQUIRED. Semantic role for UX grouping and behavior     - All other fields: OPTIONAL but recommended for better tracking

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**var_field** | **str** | REQUIRED. Stable semantic label for this blob. Use descriptive names like &#39;video_segment&#39;, &#39;thumbnail&#39;, &#39;source_video&#39;, etc. Avoid internal implementation details like array indices. This field is used for programmatic access and should be consistent across documents. | 
**role** | **str** | REQUIRED. Semantic role determining how this blob should be treated. &#39;source&#39;: Original input media from buckets or uploads. &#39;processed&#39;: Derived content created by feature extractors (segments, frames). &#39;thumbnail&#39;: Preview images for UI display. &#39;artifact&#39;: Generated outputs (reports, analysis results). &#39;aux&#39;: Supporting or auxiliary files. Used by UI for grouping and displaying blobs appropriately. | [optional] [default to 'source']
**type** | **str** | REQUIRED. Media type of the blob content. Determines how the blob should be rendered or processed. Use &#39;other&#39; for custom or unknown types. | [optional] [default to 'other']
**url** | **str** | REQUIRED. Permanent URL to the blob content. S3 URLs (s3://bucket/key) are automatically converted to presigned HTTPS URLs by the API. HTTP/HTTPS URLs are returned as-is. This is the canonical reference to the blob that persists across API calls. | 
**filename** | **str** | OPTIONAL. Original filename or leaf name of the blob. Useful for downloads and display purposes. Example: &#39;segment_0.mp4&#39;, &#39;thumbnail.jpg&#39; | [optional] 
**size_bytes** | **int** | OPTIONAL. Size of the blob in bytes. Useful for progress indicators and storage tracking. | [optional] 
**content_type** | **str** | OPTIONAL. MIME type of the blob content. Used for proper content-type headers when serving files. Example: &#39;video/mp4&#39;, &#39;image/jpeg&#39;, &#39;application/pdf&#39; | [optional] 
**checksum** | **str** | OPTIONAL. Checksum or hash of the blob content for integrity verification. Format: &#39;algorithm:hash&#39; (e.g., &#39;sha256:abc123...&#39;) | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | OPTIONAL. Timestamp when the blob was created or uploaded. ISO 8601 format. Useful for tracking blob lifecycle and cleanup. | [optional] 
**source_blob_id** | **str** | OPTIONAL. Cross-reference to the source blob ID from the bucket object. Used for lineage tracking: connects processed blobs back to their original sources. Example: A video segment references the original video blob that it was extracted from. | [optional] 
**presigned_url** | **str** | RESPONSE ONLY. Time-limited HTTPS URL for direct access to the blob. Automatically generated by the API when documents are retrieved. NOT REQUIRED when creating blobs - leave empty, API will populate. Typically expires after 1 hour. Use for immediate media playback or download. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from mixpeek.models.blob_url_ref import BlobURLRef

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of BlobURLRef from a JSON string
blob_url_ref_instance = BlobURLRef.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(BlobURLRef.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
blob_url_ref_dict = blob_url_ref_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of BlobURLRef from a dict
blob_url_ref_from_dict = BlobURLRef.from_dict(blob_url_ref_dict)
